This project aims to implement a algorithm proposed in paper as follows:

[Pagel V, Lenzo K, Black A. Letter to Sound Rules for Accented Lexicon Compression[J]. 1998, cmp-lg/9808010.](https://arxiv.org/abs/cmp-lg/9808010)

## Project Structure
* **g2p_data_pre_process.py** - a python script to pre-process g2p data by rules.
* **g2p_aligner.py** - a python script to train model by EM & DTW algorithm.
* **assets/** - store the training data sets.
* **log/** - settle the log files.
